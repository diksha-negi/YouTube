**Project Summary**

Developed a robust backend project using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, bcrypt, and several other technologies. This project serves as a fully functional backend system that encompasses every critical feature needed for modern applications. Specifically, I built a video hosting website akin to YouTube that includes functionalities such as login, signup, video uploading, like/dislike options, commenting, replying, subscribing, unsubscribing, and much more.

I employed industry-standard practices like JWT for secure authentication, bcrypt for password encryption, and implemented both access and refresh tokens to ensure secure and efficient token management. I invested a significant amount of time and effort into this project, and I am confident that it offers valuable insights and learning opportunities for anyone interested in backend development.
